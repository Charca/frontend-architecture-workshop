| Lauren (Frontend Developer) | Ship code to production confidently, without fear of breaking her teammate's features        | The current big ball of mud architecture makes it hard to visualize the impact of a code change.     |
| Maxi (Customer Persona)     | Order delicious food from his phone or computer and have it delivered as quickly as possible | Maxi is hungry and wants to eat a taco plate right now.                                              |

## Contraints

## Influential Functional Requirements

_To be completed... by you! See Exercise 2 for more details._

## Other Influencers

- Currently, the frontend team is a single team of 4 developers, but this is expected to change as the number of developers is expected to triple in size over the next year.
- Every frontend developer on the team has experience working with React and Next.js, and some of them are also comfortable working with Vue.js and Laravel.
- Not everyone on the team is comfortable working with TypeScript.
